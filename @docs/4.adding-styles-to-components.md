# Adding Styles to Components

> The following guide assumes you have some familiarity with React and JSX concepts. At minimum, it is recommended that you have some experience with JavaScript before continuing with this guide. There are some great free resources available at [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), otherwise continue reading.

## Using static classNames

CSS class naming still remains the most effective way to ensure that you can create reusable styles for your various campaign styles. Using static classNames, you can apply styles from campaign editor styles and apply them throughout various parts of your Raisely website:

```js
(RaiselyComponents) => {
    // simple declarative
    const PrimaryDiv = ({ children }) => (
        <div className="my-primary-div" />
    );

    const SecondaryDiv = ({ children }) => (
        <div className="my-secondary-div" />
    );

    return () => (
        <React.Fragment>
            <PrimaryDiv />
            <SecondaryDiv />
        </React.Fragment>
    );
}
```

Raisely also provides several css helpers to ensure you can get the most out of your css styles. These helpers include means of colorizing sections of components based on colors, as well as hiding sections of components depending on page state, like if a profile is owned by the current user, or the page currently in view.

### Static CSS helpers

#### Color helpers

The below table represents available color helpers based on your campaign's design configuration. `{color}` represents either `primary` or `secondary`, which are specified within your campaign's theme configuration.

| shade name | background class | text color class | 
|---|---|---|
| normal | `block-{color}` | `color-{color}` |
| light | `block-{color}-light` | `color-{color}-lighter` |
| lighter | `block-{color}-lighter` | `color-{color}-lighter` |
| lightest | `block-{color}-lightest` | `color-{color}-lightest` |
| super-light | `block-{color}-super-light` | `color-{color}-super-light` |
| dark | `block-{color}-dark` | `color-{color}-dark` | 
| darker | `block-{color}-darker` | `color-{color}-darker` |
| darkest | `block-{color}-darkest` | `color-{color}-darkest` |

```js
(RaiselyComponents) => {
    // define both our campaign theme color aliases and their available shades
    const colorTypes = [
        'block-primary', 'block-secondary',
        'color-primary', 'color-secondary',
    ];

    const colorShades = [
        'super-light', 'lightest', 'lighter', 'light',
        'dark', 'darker', 'darkest',
    ];

    // generate list of class names for helper demo
    const colorHelperClasses = colorTypes.concat(...colorTypes.map(colorType => 
        colorShades.map(shadeName => `${colorType}-${shadeName}`)
    )).sort();

    // return mapping of available colors as simple div elements
    return () => colorHelperClasses.map(className => (
        <div className={className} key={className}>
            {className}
        </div>
    ));
}
```

## Using Emotion

[Emotion](https://5bb1495273f2cf57a2cf39cc--emotion.netlify.com/docs) is a Javascript based dynamic style solution that is used internally by Raisely, and for various aspects of the client.

Emotion's `styled` and `css` helpers allow you to build components that aren't as closely dependant on your existing campaign styles, since the HTML `class` they are assigned is uniquely represented when it's rendered.

This means that unlike typical CSS classes that are more easily targeted, CSS classes and elements made using emotion aren't easily targeted, and wont conflict with other emotion generated classes.

```js
(RaiselyComponents) => {
    const { styled, css } = RaiselyComponents;

    // a HTML div that will have a unique className already assigned
    // to it via styled
    const MyRedDiv = styled('div')`
        color: #fff;
        background: #f00;
    `;

    // builds a reusable string that can be appended as a className
    const myBlueClass = css`
        color: #fff;
        background: #00f;
    `;

    return () => (
        <React.Fragment>
            <MyRedDiv />
            <div className={myBlueClass} />
        </React.Fragment>
    );
}
```

As demonstrated above, the emotion helpers provide two helpers; `styled` which enables developers to create components with deterministic styled bound to each element, and `css` which acts a declarative way to define a set of styles for React components without needing an previously-used CSS class name appended. Both of these helpers provide the means of preventing style conflicts within you other components and existing campaign theme styles.
